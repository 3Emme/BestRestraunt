## Description

This project was written during week 9 of Epicodus.

### Objectives

Create a website where users can add their favorite restaurants based on the type of cuisine they offer.

Add a Cuisine class. Build out all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for this class. Remember that "Read" means to view a particular cuisine and to list out all of the cuisines.

Add a Restaurant class. Build out all CRUD functionality for this class.

Add properties other than name to your Restaurant class so that you can display descriptive information about the restaurants.

Make the connection between a cuisine and a restaurant in the database. A cuisine can have many restaurants, but a restaurant can only be attached to one cuisine.

Allow a user to search for all of a cuisine's restaurants.
